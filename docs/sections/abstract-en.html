<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The User Ontology is an ontology that models users of the iSee platform. This includes capturing information related to users, their pre-existing knowledge (e.g., knowledge of the domain and/or AI techniques), their intent (i.e. goal/need for an explanation), and industry they are involved in.
	
		
This ontology was created as part of the iSee project (https://isee4xai.com) which received funding from EPSRC under the grant number EP/V061755/1. iSee is part of the CHIST-ERA pathfinder programme for European coordinated research on future and emerging information and communication technologies.</span>
